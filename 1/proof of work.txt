1. Blockchain is the combination of blocks


2. What is Proof of work / Mining?
Validates blocks and check whether sending having enough coins or tokens that the sender is sending!

How Proof of Work works?
It uses hashing in this case (SHA256) Alogrithm

Why use SHA256?
Bcz to have unique Id for data no-matter how much small or big data but get unique id
and in blocks if someone tries to change one block let's say 5th block then 6th will report
that previous block hash changed and it will disturb whole blockchain to alert about data change
so that's why to avoid data changing from blocks SHA256 is being used!
